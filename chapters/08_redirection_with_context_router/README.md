# Redirection with Context.Router
**this.context.router.history** offers some great functionality to maintain history in the react router application. It comes inbuilt in react router for web applications and It is almost same as [history](https://github.com/reacttraining/history) module. Over here we are only going to see the redirection with its push method.

In the `components/form.jsx`, on clicking on **Redirect to Home** button, redirection to home page **"/"** is done using `this.context.router.history.push('/')`.
