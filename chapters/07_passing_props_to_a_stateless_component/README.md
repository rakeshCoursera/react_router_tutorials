# Passing Props to a Stateless Component
In this chapter, we are going to build a stateless child component with some events that are handled by the parent component. The following things are done in this chapter-
* Created a route with path **"/form/"** and with an optional param **"/: type?"**.
* Added a `<NavLink>` for the above route to navigate on UI.
* Props and states are passed to the child component **Form** with the event handlers.
* Props values are passed from the child to the parent component when an event is triggered.

For the detailed code look into the file `components/app.jsx` and `components/form.jsx`.
